 Categorizing Arabic News Data

## 📌 Introduction  
In the context of Arabic news headlines, analyzing and categorizing text helps understand public sentiment across various topics in the Arab world.  

For example:  
- **المالية في الاقتصاد يرفع معنويات السوق** → reflects positive emotion and economic improvement.  
- **فقدان عدة أرواح في حادث سير** → conveys tragedy and sorrow due to loss of lives.

## 📊 Data Description  
- **Source:** Collected from reputable Arabic news outlets such as *Al Jazeera News*.  
- **Size:** A sizable dataset containing numerous Arabic headlines.  
- **Objective:** Classify Arabic news headlines into main categories to understand content distribution and themes.

---

## 🧩 Categories and Labels  
The dataset is divided into **four main categories**:  
- 🏛️ **Politics**  
- 💰 **Economy**  
- 🔬 **Science**  
- 🎭 **Culture**

## 🔍 Data Analysis  
- Preprocessed the Arabic text (normalization, stopwords removal, tokenization).  
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.  
- Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models for classification.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithms  
Three algorithms were tested for classification performance:  
1. **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**  
2. **Random Forest Classifier**  
3. **Logistic Regression**  

After experimentation, the **SVC** achieved the **highest accuracy** at **93.4%** in classifying Arabic news headlines.
